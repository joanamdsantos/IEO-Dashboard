                                <br> According to EIA the Energy market projections are uncertain because the events that shape future developments in technology, demographic changes, economic trends, and resource availability that drive energy use are fluid.
                                <br> The scenarios evaluated consist in the variation of oil prices and economic growth in comparison to the reference case.<br><br>
